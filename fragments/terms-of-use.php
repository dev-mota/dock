			Our Services display some content that is not DockThor’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law.

      		As a basic principle, you may use this web site anonymously (i.e. guest user). However, our web server automatically records any access. That means: when you access our web site, our server records non-personal data (e.g. type of internet browser and operating system used, domain name of the web site from which you came, average time spent on the site, pages viewed). Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you’ve disabled this function in your internet browser. This information is stored anonymously and used only for statistical purposes. Any identification of an individual or any inference about the activities of an individual is impossible.<br><br>

			<h4 class="modal-title" id="purposeTermsModalLabel">Purpose of Use</h4>
